### Site Overview

'Which 'Wich' Is a goofy three.js app aimed to generate sandwiches and their ingredients based on the user's preferences.
Ingredients are added and removed via checkboxes and are then floated along a specific path in between two pieces of bread.
This aim of this app is to inspire users to make their own sandwiches with the ingredients we have provided.

### Tools Used

  - Three.js
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - jQuery

### Features to implement

  - Align ingredients and bread together to form the sandwich structure
  - Adding colour to the checkbox
  - Add a 'scene floor' that resembles a dining plate and table
